    There's no real data collected by this website. Don't even have google analytics or anything.<br>
    So no personal data is passed onto 3rd parties, or used for anything <br>
    Doubt it will ever have any tracking/analytics (adhering to GDPR policies is just a pain. Easier to just not collect data), but if that changes, I'll add a banner to front-page informing people.<br>
    If you do want your data/name removed or changed from standings, or your forum account nuking, best to contact the facebook page <br>
    And we'll try and get your data redacted :)
